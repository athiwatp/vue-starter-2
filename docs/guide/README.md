## Why not vue-cli or nuxt.js ?

This boilerplate is opinionated, aiming to educate and empower users to essentially configure their own framework,
ideally suited to their needs. It also includes as less libraries as possible to keep you flexible and to enable you
to implement every product requirement that comes down the road.

Use cases for this boilerplate:
- The requirements for the product might change and you want to maintain maximum flexibility and control.
- You'd like to focus on developing skills that will transfer across any Vue project.
- You're working in a large team, so you need tooling to help everyone avoid common mistakes,
  write in a consistent style, and avoid bikeshedding in PRs.
